## Start developing the pomodoro app with React


First you need to get installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) which will serve us as a package manager.
*Recommended version: LTS*


Then, check if you have installed Node correctly, running in a terminal the following command:
`npm -v`
*This command should just display the version you have currently installed.*


Next, enter the project folder and run:
`npm install`


Once that has finished, run:
`npm start`


To see a live version of the app, go to [This link](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


---


To launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode, run:
`npm test`


See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


For building the app for production run:
`npm run build`
*It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.*


### Your app is ready to be deployed!
