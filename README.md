# Pomodoro project

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method based on 25-minute stretches of focused work broken by five-minute breaks. Longer breaks are taken after four consecutive work intervals. Each work interval is called a pomodoro, the Italian word for tomato.

## Description

The first thing the user will notice when starting the app is the timer. It starts with 25 minutes and, once the "beggin" button is clicked, it will start a countdown until it reaches zero. During this time frame the user is expected to be focused working on a task without interruptions. Once the timer hits 0, it will automatically begin a new countdown, this time from 5 minutes instead of 25. This time frame is meant to serve as a break period in which the user can unwind and relax for a short time. Once this "work-relax" cycle has been repeated 4 times, a new countdown begins. This time the relax period lasts for 15 minutes, which serves as a reward for having completed 4 work cycles. The app keeps track of the cycle count and what kind of break the user is supposed to take.
A pause and a continue button have been implemented. This allows for more flexibility for the user, who can adapt to unplanned interruptions. For this same reason a restart button has been implemented which restarts the current time frame. 
The user also has the option to write a list of tasks to better visualize what needs to be done and in which order.

## For users

## Start developing the pomodoro app with React


First you need to get installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) which will serve us as a package manager.
*Recommended version: 20.9.0*


Then, check if you have installed Node correctly, running in a terminal the following command:

```shell
npm -v
```

*This command should just display the version you have currently installed.*


Next, enter the project folder and run:

```shell
npm install
```

Once that has finished, run:

```shell
npm start
```


To see a live version of the app, go to *localhost* at por *3000* to view it in your browser.


The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


#### Testing

To launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode, run:

```shell
npm test
```


See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


For building the app for production run:

```shell
npm run build
```
*It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.*


See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

Your app is ready to be deployed!
